                "answer": "Although we provide both types of accounts: regular and agency accounts.\n\nI have a recommendation that if the customer's monthly budget is below $30,000, they should not run ads on an agency account.\n\nReasons:\n– The fees are expensive, with monthly maintenance fees of around $300-400 and setup fees of $400 per session.\n– In other words, with a budget below $30,000 per month, <span class=\"text-blue-300\">regular ad accounts are usually more cost-effective</span> than agency accounts by about $700-$800 in the first month and $400 in the following months.\n– While agency accounts are undoubtedly <span class=\"text-blue-300\">stronger</span> than regular accounts, we provide <span class=\"text-blue-300\">free replacements</span> if the Facebook ads account gets disabled. In summary, the quality is <span class=\"text-blue-300\">nearly the same</span>.\n\nAccording to my opinion, agency accounts are only suitable for <span class=\"text-blue-300\">large-scale projects</span> with short running durations, such as ICO campaigns, and require a budget of $10,000 per day or higher."
