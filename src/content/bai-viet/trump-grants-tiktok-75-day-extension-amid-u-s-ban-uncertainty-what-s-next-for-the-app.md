**The TikTok Ban Timeline: A Brief Overview**

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the TikTok sell-off bill, officially titled the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” which led to the app’s scheduled shutdown on Sunday, January 19. This law, approved by the Senate, required TikTok to cease operations in the U.S. unless its ownership was transferred to a U.S.-based company.

However, the Biden Administration, which was in its final days, decided not to enforce the law immediately. It placed this responsibility on the incoming President, Donald Trump, who was inaugurated just a day later. This created a period of uncertainty, leading to a temporary blackout over the weekend as app stores and providers faced potential fines of up to $5,000 per user for violating the law.

**How Trump’s Intervention Changed the Situation**

President Trump’s intervention brought some clarity to the situation. He assured providers, such as app stores, that they wouldn’t face penalties for allowing TikTok on their platforms despite the new law’s requirements. While Apple and Google remain cautious and have refused to support TikTok in their stores due to liability concerns, Oracle, TikTok’s back-end support partner, accepted Trump’s assurances. As a result, TikTok continues to operate in the U.S., albeit without being available on the official app stores.

**The 75-Day Extension: Legal Ramifications**

In one of his first Executive Orders, President Trump granted TikTok a 75-day extension to negotiate an alternative arrangement for its continued operation in the U.S. While this extension might appear like a lifeline for the app, legal experts are questioning whether it is valid. Since the Senate-approved law is already in effect, the extension may not have any legal standing.

Had Trump granted the extension before the January 19 deadline, it could have had legal implications. However, applying it retrospectively raises concerns that TikTok could still be in violation of U.S. law, with providers potentially facing fines.

**Is Oracle at Risk?**

With TikTok still operational, questions have arisen about whether Oracle, which helps run TikTok’s back-end infrastructure in the U.S., could face fines under the new law. While Trump has promised to protect Oracle from prosecution, the company’s position remains precarious.

Apple and Google, on the other hand, are understandably more cautious. If they were to go against Trump’s wishes and support the app, they could face penalties, especially if Trump later changes his stance or allows them to be fined.

**National Security Concerns: Will Trump Change His Mind?**

Although Trump’s decision to allow TikTok to continue operating may seem like a business move, it’s important to consider the national security concerns that influenced the Senate’s overwhelming vote to ban the app. The vote to ban TikTok passed with 431 votes in favor and only 83 against, indicating serious bipartisan concerns about the app’s security risks.

Trump himself has not yet received the full, confidential briefing on TikTok’s potential security risks, which could alter his position once he’s made aware of the details. The full briefing, which contains sensitive national security information, has not been made public, but it played a significant role in the Senate’s vote.

**The Bigger Picture: TikTok’s Future in the U.S.**

Although Trump has framed his negotiations with TikTok as a potential opportunity to secure U.S. ownership in the app, the situation remains unstable. Whether TikTok will remain operational in the U.S. or whether it will eventually be forced to sell off its operations remains unclear.

For now, TikTok is still available and functional in the U.S. But the legal and political uncertainty surrounding its future means that it’s not out of the woods yet. The next 75 days will be crucial in determining the app’s future in the region.

**Conclusion: What Should You Expect Moving Forward?**

How you view the situation ultimately depends on your perspective. As of now, TikTok is operational, but with significant legal and political hurdles to overcome. The outcome of the next 75 days will shape the app’s future in the U.S. and may have broader implications for tech companies and national security policies.
