### How Countdown Bidding Works



**Create an “Auction Only” listing**

Sellers add their product to TikTok Shop and label it “Auction Only,” which disables the standard “Add to Cart” button.

**Provide full product details**

As with collectibles or pre-owned luxury items, you must include condition, authenticity, and any other relevant specs so bidders can make informed offers.

**Launch the auction in-stream**

During your live broadcast, pull in the listing, set a starting bid and auction duration, and watch viewers compete in real time.

**Finalize the sale**

Bids are visible to everyone in the stream; at countdown end, the highest bidder pays immediately and the sale is completed.

### Availability & Pricing Updates

* Categories supported: Currently limited to collectibles and pre-owned luxury goods.
* Higher transaction cap: The in-app sales ceiling has been raised from $7,600 to $13,000, enabling more high-value auctions.



### Why This Matters

TikTok is doubling down on in-stream shopping, aiming to convert its massive audience into a major commerce channel. On Douyin (TikTok’s Chinese sister app), livestream auctions generated $490 billion in GMV during 2024—a 30% year-over-year jump. Internationally, TikTok hit around $30 billion GMV in the same period, signaling strong growth potential for livestream shopping outside China.



By rolling out Countdown Bidding, TikTok gives brands and creators a powerful tool to:



* Amplify engagement: Live auctions foster excitement and community interaction.
* Drive urgency: Time-limited bidding pushes viewers to act fast.
* Maximize revenue: Competitive bidding can raise final sale prices above standard retail.



As Western audiences become more comfortable with live shopping, Countdown Bidding could quickly become a must-have feature for any TikTok seller looking to stand out—and sell out—on livestream.
