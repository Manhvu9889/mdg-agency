### The Countdown to TikTok's Potential Ban

With just 22 days remaining before TikTok could be effectively forced out of the United States, President-elect Donald Trump is taking action to fulfill his campaign promise to save the app. At the very least, Trump is seeking an opportunity to negotiate an alternative solution that would keep TikTok accessible for millions of Americans.

### Trump's Legal Move to Delay TikTok's Exit

Today, the Trump transition team filed an **amicus brief** with the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting a stay of execution for TikTok. This legal maneuver aims to grant Trump the time and leverage needed to apply his "dealmaking expertise" to craft a resolution that satisfies both sides of the debate.

According to the brief:

> “Through his historic victory on November 5, 2024, President Trump received a powerful electoral mandate from American voters to protect the free speech rights of all Americans — including the 170 million Americans who use TikTok. President Trump is uniquely situated to protect these interests, because ‘the President and Vice President of the United States are the only elected officials who represent all voters in the nation.’”

### Trump's Social Media Expertise as an Advantage

The brief highlights Trump’s unique qualifications as one of the most influential social media users in history. It notes his deep familiarity with platforms like TikTok, allowing him to personally evaluate the app's value and potential threats.

> “Consistent with his commanding presence in this area, President Trump currently has 14.7 million followers on TikTok, with whom he actively communicates, allowing him to evaluate TikTok’s importance as a unique medium for freedom of expression, including core political speech.”

This positions Trump as not just a leader but also an active participant in the social media landscape, offering insights beyond those of the average user.

### Contrasting Perspectives on TikTok's Threats

While Trump advocates for TikTok’s preservation, many U.S. senators and cybersecurity officials remain wary. Classified briefings on potential influence operations have driven widespread legislative support for requiring the app’s sale. However, Trump’s personal experience with TikTok appears to have softened his stance. Unlike his initial push in 2020 to force a sale, Trump now openly supports the app, citing his own popularity on the platform as a factor.

> “I like TikTok now because I’m a ‘big star’ on the platform,” Trump has stated multiple times, emphasizing his changed perspective.

### Extending the Deadline for a New Deal

Trump’s current objective is to extend TikTok’s deadline, allowing time for negotiations to secure a new deal. This approach reflects his commitment to preserving the app for American users while ensuring national security concerns are addressed.

As the clock ticks down, Trump’s actions signal his determination to protect both free speech and digital innovation, potentially reshaping TikTok’s future in the United States.
