Meta has been encouraging advertisers to leverage its automated Advantage+ campaigns and AI-driven ad creation tools to enhance ad performance. These AI-powered solutions are designed to optimize campaign results by utilizing Meta's vast data insights.

By using Meta’s advanced ad system AI, you can automate nearly every aspect of the ad creation process—from creation and budget management to precise targeting. According to Meta, advertisers who adopt its automation tools are seeing significantly better results.

**How Much Better Are the Results?**

Meta has recently shared insights into its “Andromeda” ad retrieval process, providing key data about the uptake of Advantage+ and creative AI within campaigns.

Meta’s Andromeda system is a major upgrade to its ad matching engine, enhancing ad personalization and targeting by allowing Meta to evaluate more factors when determining which ads to display to each user.

As Meta describes it:

“Andromeda significantly enhances Meta’s ads system by integrating AI that optimizes personalization during the ad retrieval process, improving return on ad spend. Its implementation across Instagram and Facebook has led to a +6% recall improvement and an +8% quality improvement in ads shown to selected segments.”

With the volume of ads shown to each user, Meta has enhanced its ad matching system to boost delivery speed and performance, driven by user responses.

This results in even better performance with AI-generated ads. Meta reports:

“When advertisers who had not previously used Advantage+ creative turned on its AI-driven targeting features, they saw a 22% increase in Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).”

Meta has previously shared similar statistics, demonstrating that marketers using its ad automation tools are experiencing significant improvements in campaign performance.

**How Renting a Facebook Ad Account Can Enhance Your Campaign Performance**

If you’re looking to amplify the effectiveness of your ads, you might want to consider the option of **renting a Facebook Ad account**. Many advertisers find that **Facebook account rental** provides them with access to advanced features, such as the use of Meta’s AI tools, which can help optimize targeting and improve campaign performance.

Through **Facebook account rental**, you gain flexibility in scaling your advertising efforts, taking advantage of established ad accounts with a good history. This can improve the overall trustworthiness of your campaigns, enabling you to access better ad placements and lower costs.

For example, businesses utilizing **Facebook account rental** to test out Meta’s AI-driven creative tools could see performance boosts, especially when taking advantage of tools like image generation and automated targeting.

**Meta Advantage+ Campaigns: The Edge of Automation**

One of the primary benefits of Meta’s automated ad selection systems is the ability to leverage user response data across Facebook and Instagram. By using **rent Facebook ad account** options, advertisers can take advantage of these insights to refine their campaigns and reach more relevant audiences. Meta’s AI system ensures that your campaigns don’t miss any potential customer segments by relying on user engagement rather than your own understanding of the audience.

This approach is helping businesses experience enhanced engagement and actions across Meta’s platforms. According to Meta, businesses that incorporate image generation into their campaigns are seeing a +7% increase in conversions.

Meta introduced AI-driven image generation for ads earlier this year, enabling businesses to create unique images directly within the ad system. Despite some skepticism around the quality of AI-generated content, the results speak for themselves. As more than one million advertisers used Meta’s generative AI tools to create over 15 million ads in just one month, the effectiveness of AI in ad creation continues to gain momentum.
