<h2>What‚Äôs New üéµ</h2>
<p>Facebook is rolling out a feature that allows users to attach a full-length track to any text-only update, along with artist-themed backgrounds for selected musicians. Friends with audio enabled will hear the song instantly while scrolling, bringing back a nostalgic MySpace-era vibe.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a regular text post.</li>
  <li>Tap the <strong>‚ô™ Music</strong> icon.</li>
  <li>Search for a track in Facebook‚Äôs licensed music catalog.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Select the matching artist background.</li>
  <li>Publish ‚Äî anyone with sound on will hear up to 90 seconds of the song as they scroll, without changing their global audio settings.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why Facebook Is Betting on Music Again</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Higher engagement:</strong> Music already boosts watch time in Reels and Stories; extending it to the Feed is the next logical step.</li>
  <li><strong>Creator discovery:</strong> Improved musician recommendations help surface emerging artists and brand collaborations.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive pressure:</strong> TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram rely heavily on trending tracks; Facebook wants to stay competitive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities for Brands &amp; Creators</h2>

<h3>Quick FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Will it autoplay?</strong> Only for users who already have sound on.</p>
<p><strong>Can Pages use it?</strong> Yes ‚Äî Profiles and most Page categories have access at launch.</p>
<p><strong>What about copyright?</strong> All tracks come from Facebook‚Äôs licensed library, so usage is cleared within the platform.</p>

<p>Adding music to text posts might not revolutionize social media, but it‚Äôs an easy way to make updates more dynamic ‚Äî and it opens a new channel for artists and marketers to reach audiences. Facebook is likely to keep iterating until a music format truly ‚Äústicks‚Äù on the Wall again.</p>
