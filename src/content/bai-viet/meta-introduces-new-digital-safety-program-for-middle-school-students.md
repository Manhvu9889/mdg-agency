In honor of **Safer Internet Day**, Meta has announced the launch of a new **digital literacy program** designed specifically for middle schoolers. The program aims to educate kids on the dangers of online interaction, teaching them how to spot potential concerns and avoid risks, both within Meta apps and across the web more broadly.

### A Partnership with Childhelp

Created in partnership with **Childhelp**, the program introduces an innovative educational curriculum that focuses on keeping kids safe online. The curriculum includes valuable modules on how to recognize dangers such as **grooming**, **sextortion scams**, and other forms of **online exploitation**.

The initiative is designed to empower students with the knowledge they need to navigate the online world safely.

### Developed with Expert Input

As explained by Meta, the curriculum has been developed with input from a range of **child safety experts**, including:

* National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)
* Thorn
* The Department of Homeland Security
* Purdue University
* Crimes Against Children Research Center

Meta’s program provides detailed resources for parents and educators, including facilitator guides, lesson plans, and interactive activities. Engaging **videos** are also included to help bring online safety principles to life for students.

### Free Access for Schools and Educators

Meta’s digital literacy program will be **available for free** to all teachers, schools, parents, and organizations that care for young people. This includes community groups, faith-based organizations, and after-school programs.

The program is now part of the **Childhelp ‘Speak Up Be Safe’** initiative, which is already helping students of all ages handle a wide range of safety issues, from **physical abuse** and **neglect** to online **bullying**.

### Meta's Commitment to Safety

This new initiative marks a significant expansion of **Meta’s existing safety programs**, providing even more support and guidance for young users online. By collaborating with expert organizations, Meta is leveraging its reach to boost awareness of digital safety for parents and kids.

While it’s impossible to safeguard every potential online threat, this program is a valuable step in **enhancing digital literacy** and ensuring that both kids and adults are better equipped to handle the challenges of online interactions.

### Looking Ahead: Digital Safety in the Age of Virtual Reality

As we enter an era of virtual reality and more immersive online connections, the importance of such initiatives grows even more. Providing kids with the tools to understand and navigate the online world will become increasingly relevant in helping them stay safe in more advanced digital spaces.
