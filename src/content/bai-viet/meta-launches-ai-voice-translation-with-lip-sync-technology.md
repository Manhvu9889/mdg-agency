Meta is expanding content accessibility in its apps by introducing **AI-powered voice translation**. This technology not only translates audio but also **synchronizes lip movements** with the translated speech, creating a more natural viewing experience.  

## Meta AI Voice Translation

According to Meta, the system uses **your own voice’s tone and sound**, combined with **AI lip-syncing**, to make it appear as if you are truly speaking the translated language.  

For example, Facebook users can now watch a video in Spanish or English, while the speaker’s lip movements remain in sync with the translated audio.  

> “Meta AI Translations uses the sound and tone of your own voice so it feels authentically you. And the lip syncing feature matches your mouth’s movements to the translated audio.” – Meta

## How It Works

* Creators can enable or disable the **“Translate your voice with Meta AI”** option in the Reels composer.  
* You can choose to **add lip-sync with translation** or simply translate the audio without modifying visuals.  
* Before publishing, creators can **preview the translation** and accept or reject it.  

When published, viewers will be notified that the reel has been translated with Meta AI and can select their preferred language.  

## Supported Languages

* Initially, Meta supports **English ↔ Spanish translations**.  
* More languages will be added in the near future to broaden accessibility.

## Best Practices for Accuracy

To improve translation quality, Meta recommends:  

* Limiting videos to a maximum of two speakers.  
* Avoiding overlapping voices or heavy background music.  
* Remembering that building an audience in a new language may take time, similar to starting fresh.  

## Extra Feature: Manual Dubbing

In addition to AI translation, Meta now allows Page managers to **add up to 20 manual dubbed tracks** to a single Reel.  

* Viewers will hear the Reel in their preferred language.  
* Unlike AI translations, manual dubbed tracks will not lip-sync with the speaker.

## Conclusion

While not perfect, this tool opens up opportunities for creators to **reach a much wider global audience**. With AI voice translation and lip-sync features, Meta is breaking down language barriers and delivering a more authentic, multilingual experience.
