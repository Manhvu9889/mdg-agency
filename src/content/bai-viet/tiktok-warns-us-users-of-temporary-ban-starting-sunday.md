TikTok users in the U.S. are facing mixed news this weekend. As of Saturday afternoon, TikTok began notifying U.S. users that the app will be "temporarily" unavailable in the region due to a forced sell-off bill from the U.S. government. This law requires the app to either be sold to an American company or shut down entirely in the U.S.

### TikTok Faces Shutdown in the U.S.

The situation is not ideal for TikTok, which has confirmed that the app will go offline at midnight tonight. Despite its efforts to resolve the issue, TikTok has no legal way around the law, which is set to take effect soon. TikTok’s final hope for a legal resolution was with the Supreme Court, but the ruling upheld the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” effectively forcing the app to either be sold to a U.S. company or shut down. With limited time, the shutdown is now the only option for the Chinese-owned app.

### Impact on CapCut and Other Apps

This forced shutdown will also apply to other popular apps like CapCut and Lemon8. However, the good news is that these apps may soon be accessible to U.S. users once again. Incoming President Donald Trump has expressed his intention to grant TikTok a 90-day reprieve to negotiate a new solution or to allow him to work out a deal for its continued operation in the U.S.

### The Role of the Biden Administration and Trump

While there had been discussions suggesting that the Biden administration might not enforce the bill, the law mandates that app stores enforce the app's removal. Since the Biden administration couldn't guarantee no fines for app stores, the shutdown became inevitable. This opens the door for Trump, who has recently become a fan of TikTok, to take action and keep the app running in the U.S. Trump, now a “big star” on TikTok, is keen to find a way to keep the app available in the U.S., but since he doesn’t take office until Monday, he is unable to intervene before the law takes effect.

### Trump’s Role in the TikTok Situation

TikTok’s description of the shutdown as "temporary" aligns with Trump’s pledge to reinstate the app as soon as possible. It’s important to note that TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will be attending Trump’s inauguration on Monday, which signals that the situation may change rapidly.

### A Look Back at Trump’s 2020 TikTok Ban Attempt

It’s important to clarify that Trump’s efforts to ban TikTok back in 2020 were not due to national security concerns but were part of a broader effort to push back against China in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. His initial executive order aimed to ban TikTok in the U.S., but it was found that the justification for such a ban was insufficient. The Trump administration's approach lacked the evidence necessary to carry out the ban.

In 2021, the Biden administration abandoned the original TikTok sell-off push, though security agencies continued to monitor the app. It was this ongoing scrutiny that eventually led to the TikTok sell-off bill now in place.

### The Path Forward for TikTok in the U.S.

While Trump’s initial efforts to ban TikTok were unsuccessful, it seems that his support could now be the key to keeping the app in the U.S. The ultimate outcome could involve TikTok being sold to a U.S. company or a new deal being struck with China to keep the app operational.

Given Trump’s affection for the app, it seems that TikTok will only be offline for a brief period. U.S. users can likely expect the app to return soon, so there’s no need to change your marketing strategy or influencer plans.

For now, though, TikTok will be unavailable for U.S. users starting tomorrow. Stay tuned for updates!
