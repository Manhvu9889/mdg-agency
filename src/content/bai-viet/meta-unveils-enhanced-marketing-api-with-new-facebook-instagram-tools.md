<h3>1. Recommended Creator Content</h3>
<p>A new “Recommended Creator Content” feature now surfaces AI-driven organic posts and suggests approved branded content that is most likely to resonate with your audience. By analyzing engagement signals and audience preferences, the system highlights potential creator collaborators whose content aligns with your brand’s objectives.</p>

<h3>2. Extended Partnership Ads Support</h3>
<p>Building on the Partnership Ads Hub rollout in Ads Manager, the Marketing API update allows third-party providers to facilitate partnership ads directly on their platforms. New options include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single-Partner Ads Header:</strong> Businesses can now showcase one partner in the ad header—streamlining the creative and ensuring the focus stays on that collaborator.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Identity Optimization:</strong> The API automatically determines whether to feature one or both partners in the header, choosing the layout predicted to drive the best campaign results.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Enhanced Instagram Video and Stories Publishing</h3>
<p>Meta is also improving cross-platform content workflows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creators can upload Instagram videos directly to Facebook via the API.</li>
  <li>Brands and creators can publish to Instagram Stories using the Content Publishing API.</li>
  <li>The daily publishing limit has been raised to <strong>100 posts</strong> across feed, stories, and Reels, enabling higher-volume scheduling and real-time engagement opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p>These updates mean that whether you manage ads or organic content through your preferred social-media management suite, you’ll have more seamless access to Meta’s most advanced creator-focused tools.</p>
