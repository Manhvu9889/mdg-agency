Meta has extended its copyright-checking feature to Facebook’s Reels composer, giving creators a way to identify and fix potential content issues before their videos go live.

**Introducing “Copyright Check” in Reels**

Within the Reels composer, you’ll now find a “Copyright Check” toggle. When enabled, Meta scans your Reel for copyrighted material and, if detected, holds publication for one hour. This pause gives you time to address any matches—whether by editing out infringing clips or replacing audio—before the video is published.

>
> “If you turn on copyright check, your eligible reels will be scanned for copyrighted content. If copyright content is found, your reels will be held for 1 hour to allow you to correct any issues before your reel is shown to others.”

**Why Pre-Publication Scanning Matters**

Even without this setting turned on, Reels are still automatically checked after publication—and any infringement could lead to:

* Demonetization: Ad earnings redirected to rights holders
* Reduced Reach: Content deprioritized in feeds
* Audio Muting: Removal of matching soundtrack

By waiting an extra hour for a proactive scan, you can prevent these setbacks and maintain full control over your content’s distribution and monetization.

**Seamless Integration Across Meta Tools**

This enhancement aligns the Reels workflow with the existing copyright-check option in Meta Business Suite. Now, whether you’re drafting a feed post or creating a Reel, you have a consistent, built-in safeguard against inadvertent violations—right where you need it.

**What Creators Should Do**

1. Enable “Copyright Check” before uploading your Reel.
2. Review any flagged segments during the one-hour hold.
3. Edit or swap problematic audio/videos as needed.
4. Publish with confidence, knowing you’ve cleared copyright hurdles in advance.

Rolling out now to more creators worldwide, this feature helps you spend less time worrying about rights claims and more time crafting engaging Reels that reach—and resonate with—your audience.
