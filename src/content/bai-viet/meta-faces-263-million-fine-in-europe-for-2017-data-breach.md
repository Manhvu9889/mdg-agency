Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has been fined $263 million (251 million euros) by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for a data breach that occurred in 2017. This marks another significant penalty for Meta as European regulators continue to crack down on data privacy violations.

#### The Incident

The breach, as detailed by TechCrunch, was caused by a vulnerability in Facebook’s video upload feature. Hackers exploited this weakness to access personal data from 29 million Facebook users globally, including 3 million users based in the EU/EEA. The compromised information included sensitive details such as:

* Full names
* Email addresses
* Phone numbers
* Locations
* Places of work
* Dates of birth
* Religions
* Genders
* Timeline posts
* Group memberships
* Children’s personal data

#### DPC Findings

The DPC concluded that Meta had failed to implement adequate data protection measures, resulting in the unauthorized exposure of user information. According to the regulator:

“This enforcement action highlights how the failure to build in data protection requirements throughout the design and development cycle can expose individuals to very serious risks and harms, including a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Facebook profiles can, and often do, contain information about matters such as religious or political beliefs, sexual life or orientation, and similar matters that a user may wish to disclose only in particular circumstances. By allowing unauthorized exposure of profile information, the vulnerabilities behind this breach caused a grave risk of misuse of these types of data.”

#### A Pattern of Fines

This penalty adds to a growing list of financial hits for Meta in Europe. Just last month, the company was fined $841 million (797.72 million euros) for antitrust violations related to its integration of Facebook Marketplace with the main platform. Additionally, in 2023, Meta faced:

* A $1.3 billion fine from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) for transferring EU user data to the U.S. without proper safeguards.
* A $414 million penalty for forcing users to accept personalized ads without their consent.

Ongoing investigations into compliance with the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) suggest that further fines could be on the horizon.

#### Financial Impact

While the fines are substantial, Meta’s financial scale diminishes their overall impact. The company is projected to generate $160 billion in revenue this year, making these penalties more of an operational nuisance than a critical threat. However, the recurring nature of these fines highlights the growing regulatory scrutiny Meta faces in Europe.

#### Looking Ahead

Meta’s consistent clashes with European regulators emphasize the need for stronger compliance measures to avoid future penalties. The company’s ongoing challenges underline the importance of adhering to local regulations to maintain trust and minimize financial setbacks.
