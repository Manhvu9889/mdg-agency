  <h1>Instagram Tests Frame-by-Frame Like Insights for Carousel Posts</h1>

  <p>Instagram is experimenting with a new analytics metric that breaks down how many likes each individual image or video in a carousel receives. Instead of showing only a single like total for the entire post, the platform will attribute a like to whichever frame was on-screen when the user tapped the heart icon, then display that number beneath the corresponding slide.</p>

  <p>Early screenshots shared by industry watchers Lindsey Gamble and Adina Jipa reveal a tiny counter in the corner of every carousel frame, offering a quick snapshot of which slide resonated most with viewers. The data isn’t perfect—some people may simply “like” the whole set without swiping through—but a clear spike on any one image can still highlight content that outperforms the rest.</p>

  <h2>What Can Marketers Do With This?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Identify standout visuals:</strong> If a particular frame consistently attracts more likes, consider using similar imagery or themes in future posts, Reels, or ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimize slide order:</strong> Because users see the first frame by default, it usually earns the most generic likes. Test different cover images and see whether repositioning high-performing frames up front boosts overall engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Refine storytelling:</strong> Analyze less-liked slides to pinpoint where viewers lose interest. Trimming weaker content can tighten your narrative and keep people swiping.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Remember, carousel posts already enjoy an organic reach advantage. Instagram’s head, Adam Mosseri, explained last year that carousels often generate more interactions, and the app will even surface the same post a second time—automatically advancing to the next frame—if a user doesn’t engage on first view. Pair that built-in “second chance” with granular frame analytics, and you have a new lever to fine-tune both creative and distribution.</p>

  <p><em>The feature is still in limited testing, but if it rolls out widely it could give brands, creators, and social media managers a rich new data point for crafting carousel content that truly clicks with their audience. Stay tuned for broader availability and start thinking now about how slide-level insights might shape your next Instagram campaign.</em></p>
