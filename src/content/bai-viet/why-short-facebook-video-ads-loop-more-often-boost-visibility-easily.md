  <h1>Why Shorter Facebook Video Ads Might Be More Effective</h1>

  <p>Did you know that <strong>shorter Facebook video ads can loop multiple times</strong> automatically? While it might not seem like a game-changer at first glance, it‚Äôs a small but potentially impactful factor to consider in your ad strategy.</p>

  <p>According to Meta:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIn most cases, video ads on Facebook that are 30 seconds or less loop for approximately 90 seconds. Looping means that your video replays after it ends.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>This means Facebook determines looping based on total duration, not how many people watch the ad. The shorter your ad, the more loops it fits into the default 90-second window.</p>  

<h2>üìå Example Scenarios</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>30-second video:</strong> Loops 3 times (30s x 3 = 90s)</li>
    <li><strong>16-second video:</strong> Loops 6 times (16s x 6 = 96s)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Since 96 seconds is closer to the 90-second goal than 80 seconds (16s x 5), the video loops 6 times instead of 5.</p>

  <p>Of course, this all assumes the viewer doesn‚Äôt skip or scroll past your ad. But if they don‚Äôt, shorter ads could offer more brand impressions in a single exposure session.</p>

  <h2>üí° Additional Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Videos longer than 30 seconds do not auto-loop</strong> ‚Äî after they end, the thumbnail appears with a play button.</li>
    <li><strong>On Instagram:</strong> All videos loop continuously as long as they're visible on screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Meta may dynamically adjust</strong> the looping time from less than 90 seconds up to 180 seconds to optimize performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üëâ Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>While not a primary factor, this behavior could make <strong>short-form video ads more valuable</strong> in certain campaigns ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre aiming for repeated message delivery and stronger brand recall within a single view.</p>
