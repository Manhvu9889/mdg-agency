We may be just weeks away from seeing **Meta’s next-level smart glasses** in retail stores. Reports suggest that Meta is planning to launch its new **“Hypernova” camera-equipped glasses** at the upcoming **Meta Connect conference on September 17th**. This launch is expected to introduce a **heads-up camera display**, visible directly in the wearer’s field of view.

## A Bridge to Full AR Glasses

The **Hypernova glasses** are positioned as a **transition device** between Meta’s current smart glasses and its eventual **full AR wearables**. Early reports highlight several new capabilities:

* **Camera-equipped heads-up display**
* **Revolutionary wrist-controlled UI** powered by Meta’s EMG technology
* Improved ergonomics and new functionalities for everyday use

While Meta hasn’t officially revealed many details, leaked images have provided early glimpses of the hardware.

## Specs: Weight and Price

Industry analyst **Mark Gurman** has revealed more about the product:

* **Weight:** Around **70 grams**, which is 20 grams heavier than the current Ray-Ban Meta glasses.  
* **Price:** Expected at **$800**, significantly reduced from Meta’s initial $1,000+ projections.

This positions Hypernova as a **premium yet more affordable** option in the growing smart glasses market.

## Meta’s Market Dominance

Meta is already leading the smart glasses sector. According to new data from **Counterpoint Research**:

> “Shipments of Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses grew over 200% YoY, reflecting strong market demand and increased manufacturing capacity at Luxottica, Meta’s key production partner. Luxottica’s retail channels, including Ray-Ban stores, Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters, account for a significant portion of sales.”

### Key Figures:

* **73% global market share** for smart glasses in H1 2025  
* Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses remain the **top-selling device** of their type  
* Expansion with **Oakley smart glasses** further strengthens Meta’s portfolio

## Looking Ahead: The Road to AR Glasses

The Hypernova release represents a **stepping stone** toward Meta’s long-term AR vision. The company is expected to launch **full AR glasses by 2027**, and by then, Meta could be firmly established as the **industry standard**.

Other competitors are also entering the space:

* **Apple** is developing its own AR devices  
* **Snapchat** is exploring an earlier market entry with its AR glasses  

Still, Meta’s consistent **product updates, market traction, and retail partnerships** suggest it may continue to dominate.
